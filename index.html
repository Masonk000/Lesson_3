        <h2 class="tagline">Full Time Wake Tech Student</h2>

        <p>Hello! My name is Mason Kane. A little about me, I am a full time student at Wake Tech Community college and work part time at a dog daycare/boarding kennel. When im not working, or doign school I like to play video games with my friends or watch movies with my mom. 
          The game I have been playing most recently is Baulders Gate 3, a role playing game based on the table top game dungens and dragon. It is amazing how they have replecated the creativity that is possible in the table top game. It is really not something I ever thought I would see in a video game. The movie I watched with my mother was the movie Philadelphia, featuing Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington. It was a very interesting persective, especailly for someoen young like me. It takes place barely 30 years ago but its like a different era.  </p>
